## ANALYZING IMDB RATINGS OF MOVIES ACROSS 100 YEARS.
This repository contains an analysis of [IMDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb) ratings of movies across 100 years. The insights were used to advise on the criterias to have n mind when selecting a movie to watch from a collection. The data was also used to ascertain if IMDB is a reliable platform to use when checking for ratings of movies. This repository contains the summary of the project and the coding materials. Further analysis and in-depth visulization is published in my medium article [here](https://medium.com/@eddy.esu.22/deliberations-of-a-movie-buff-tips-to-aid-choosing-your-next-cinematic-experience-2fb001372be8).

## SAMPLE SPACE
  After data engineering and filtering, the plot of each genre allocation is shown below.

## FINDINGS
**1** The histogram and the density plot of the movies across 100 years is a normal distribution- also termed a [gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).

 **2** When trying to pick a movie  based on duration, animated movies have the highest tendency to be the shortest (75-85 minutes).

 **3** [Morgan Freeman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman) is in more than one of the four highest ever rated movies by IMDB.
 
 **4** The trend of the mean per year suggests between 1965-1975 having two highest averages with 1972 having the highest mean throughout the 100 years and 1966 the second highest mean.
